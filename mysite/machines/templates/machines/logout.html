        <h1>Logged Out</h1>
        <p>You have been successfully logged out.</p>
        <p><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Login</a> again</p>
        <!-- You can add more content or links as needed -->
    </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the logout.html template includes a message confirming that the user has been logged out and provides a link to the login page ('login' URL). You can customize this template further to match the styling and content of your project as needed.
